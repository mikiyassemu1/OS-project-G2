**Course**: COSC 519 — Graduate Operating Systems  
# x86-64 Long Mode Bootloader (Group 2)


## 📁 Files

- `boot.asm`: Stage 1 bootloader loaded by BIOS (16-bit real mode)
- `loader.asm`: Stage 2 loader that sets up Protected Mode, paging, and enters Long Mode
- `Makefile`: Automates build and run process
- `boot.img`: Bootable floppy image generated by the Makefile

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Make sure you have **NASM** and **QEMU** installed.

To build everything:

```bash
make
```

This compiles both stages and creates `boot.img`.

## ▶️ Run the Bootloader

```bash
make run
```

This runs the image in QEMU and shows the boot messages, including confirmation of Long Mode and a 64-bit instruction execution.

## 🧹 Clean Build Artifacts

```bash
make clean
```

This deletes generated `.bin` and `.img` files.

## ✅ Output

When run in QEMU, you should see output similar to:

```
Group2 Bootloader...
Entered Protected Mode
Entered 64-bit Mode
RAX=123456789ABCDEF0
```

This confirms successful entry into Long Mode and correct execution of 64-bit instructions.
